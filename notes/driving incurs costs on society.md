- more cars on the road means more pollution and congestion
	- these [negative externalities](negative%20externalities) are not borne by the driver, but instead passed onto society
- driving causes wear and tear on roads
	- this is partially paid for by the gas tax (and most wear comes from trucks), but gas taxes don't entirely cover it
- driving is energy intensive compared to more efficient modes of transportation (e.g. mass transit), and requires substantial additional infrastructure (e.g. gas pipelines)
