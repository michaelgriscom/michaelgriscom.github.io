- [[the US  is experiencing a housing affordability crisis]]
- How do we fix it?
	- Step 1 of [[the problem solving process]]: Understand the problem
		- [[the housing affordability crisis is a supply side problem]]
			- The solution needs to come on the supply side (i.e. more houses)
			- Demand side solutions are only bandaids
				- Rent assistance
				- UBI
			- Need more [[YIMBY]] attitudes
		- Our perspective on housing needs to shift
			- [[housing can be built while bolstering diversity]], and conversely limiting housing supply drives gentrification
			- [housing should be deflationary](housing%20should%20be%20deflationary.md)
	- Step 2 of [the problem solving process](the%20problem%20solving%20process.md): Devise a plan
		- Increase supply by building more housing
			- How do we let more houses be built?
				- [free markets efficiently allocate limited resources](free%20markets%20efficiently%20allocate%20limited%20resources.md)
					- in this case, land is the limited resource
				- removing regulations will make the market more free
					- this means that [zoning restrictions should be loosened](zoning%20restrictions%20should%20be%20loosened.md)
				- additionally, [tax policy can incentivize the productive use of land](tax%20policy%20can%20incentivize%20the%20productive%20use%20of%20land.md)
				- We could build social housing, but leveraging markets and incentives are very powerful, light touch policies that have minimal overheads. Additionally, regulation and taxation are core competencies of government, whereas construction is not
			- What kind should be built?
				- Any! Even [[new market rate housing decreases housing prices]]
				- If market inefficiencies are discovered (e.g. unmet demand for ultra-affordable [[single room occupancy]]) then social housing could be built
