- the problem
	- [free parking isn't free](free%20parking%20isn't%20free.md), the costs fall onto all of society via
		- higher rent
		- higher prices on goods
		- the opportunity cost of the land
	- universal car ownership is infeasible, so providing free parking for everyone is unrealistic
-  Analogs that put the absurdity in sharper relief
	- Imagine if roads were financed similarly, and new housing developments had to fund road expansion to add road capacity
	- Free parking is like rent control for cars, artificially preventing the cost of car ownership from increasing
	- Gas isn't free, parking is the privilege to keep your car in a particular location and likewise shouldn't be free
	- Imagine if restaraunts had free desert; it would just be factored into the price of each menu item, increasing the demand for desserts and causing non-dessert eaters to subsidize the dessert eaters
- how should we solve it?
	- Eliminate parking minimums, charge for street parking, and let the market set rates
- why is this a good solution?
	-  [free markets efficiently allocate limited resources](../pages/free%20markets%20efficiently%20allocate%20limited%20resources.md), in this case parking
		- this means better allocation of capital because [efficient markets minimize deadweight loss](efficient%20markets%20minimize%20deadweight%20loss.md)
	- [markets should have as little regulation as possible](markets%20should%20have%20as%20little%20regulation%20as%20possible.md)
	- developers can decide how many parking spaces they need
	- the revenue can be reinvested in the community
		- gives an extra revenue stream
		- creates an incentive for locals to improve the desireability of visiting
	- this is a bottom up approach and [bottom up systems bolster liberal democracies](bottom%20up%20systems%20bolster%20liberal%20democracies.md)
- what are the counter arguments?
	- Reduces accessibility
		- This is backwards, mobility and proximity are two key components of accessibility, and we should emphasize proximity instead
			- free parking also hinders proximity, and since it increases congestion it also hinders mobility
	- Reduced economic activity
		- The data don't show evidence of this. Generally there are more visitors but they stay for a shorter period of time
	- there wouldn't be enough parking
		- [[shortages result from underpricing]], parking can be priced to attain any level of availability
	- parking is a public good
		- it isn't, a [[public good]] is something non-excludable and non-rivalrous
			- parking is excludable because parking fees are easily enforced
			- parking is rivalrous because only one person can use it at a time
	- parking will be too expensive
		- if it's not worth it to the driver to park, then it shouldn't be worth it to society to pay for it either
		- Can be thought of as "charge others what they would charge you"
- what will the effects be?
	- increased density (since less space is occupied by parked cars) and more mixed use neighborhoods (because walking will be more important)
		- this is good because [dense, mixed-use neighborhoods are good for individuals and communities](dense,%20mixed-use%20neighborhoods%20are%20good%20for%20individuals%20and%20communities.md)
		- this is also good because it could increase the housing supply, which can help with [the housing affordability crisis](the%20housing%20affordability%20crisis.md) because [the housing affordability crisis is a supply side problem](the%20housing%20affordability%20crisis%20is%20a%20supply%20side%20problem.md)
	- more types of housing will be built that are currently infeasible due to parking minimums (e.g. [courtyard houses](courtyard%20houses))
		- this is good because [diverse housing creates diverse neighborhoods](diverse%20housing%20creates%20diverse%20neighborhoods.md)
	- more efficient use of land (cars spend most of their lives parked and doing nothing) because
	- prices could be proportioal to vehicle size, creating an incentive for smaller cars
		- this is good because [[smaller cars are better for communities]]
		- this is fair because renting housing scales with apartment size (all else being equal) so renting parking should as well
	- car use will be reduced
		- this is good because [reducing car usage is beneficial for individuals and communities](reducing%20car%20usage%20is%20beneficial%20for%20individuals%20and%20communities.md)
	-  It will become less valuable for solo drivers (since they can't split the cost), people parking for long periods, and people who don't place a high premium on urgency to park nearby, resulting in improved convenience and more efficienct use of the space
	- Removing parked car areas will increase road throughput, either by adding a lane for moving cars or allowing for a bike lane/wider sidewalk
