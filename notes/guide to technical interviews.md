- Interviewer's goal
	- See how you solve problems
		- Analytical ability
		- Intellectual curiousity
	- See how you communicate
	- See what your technical capacity is
- Interviewing Guide
	- Every interview is unique, so find out what works for you
	- Before coding
		- Clarify the problem
		- Establish requirements
			- Is input sanitization needed?
			- What is the input/output type?
			- Are there any resource constraints? (threading, memory, network etc)
		- Outline an approach
			- Think about test cases early
			- Mention drawbacks
			- Outline multiple ideas if they occur to you
	- While coding
		- Think out loud while solving
		- Communicate!
			- If you're stuck
			- If something feels like a potential bug
			- If you're assuming something (e.g. valid input)
			- If you're making a tradeoff (e.g. space vs time)
			- "When in doubt, talk it out"
		- Be receptive to feedback
		- Try to write readable code, consider breaking down into functions
			- Some interviewers will let you assume helper functions are written
	- After coding
		- Test your solution
			- Think about edge cases
			- black box/white box testing
			- Beware of overconfidence
				- Try not to prematurely claim that the code works correctly
		- Discuss the characteristics of your solution and how to improve it
			- Runtime/resource consumption
			- High/low level structure
			- Scalability
			- Generalizability
