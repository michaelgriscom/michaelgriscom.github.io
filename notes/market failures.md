- A market failure is when a free market produces an inefficient outcome
- examples
	- externalities
		- e.g. pollution negatively impacts [[the commons]],  but can be produced freely
	- information assymetry
		- e.g. someone selling a car knows how it's been used and any issues with it that the buyer may not be able to notice
	- [[factor immobility]]
		- e.g. it's expensive economically, socially, etc. to move to a new location
	- monopolies
		- e.g. a large individual company can set prices, sidestepping price discovery within the market
