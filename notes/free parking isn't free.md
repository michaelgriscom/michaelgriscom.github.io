- there are two kinds of parking: on street and off street
- providing free parking has a lot of costs
	- on street
		- opportunity cost of the land
			- could be used for housing, lanes for cars
		- decreased traffic throughput
			- fewer lanes for moving traffic
			- more congestion
				- people looking for parking
				- people entering/leaving parking spaces
	- off street
		- opportunity cost of the land
			- "restaurants typically need 3x the land area of the business for parking, and commercial buildings need 2x"
		- increased construction costs, especially for underground parking garages
		- "The total subsidy for off-street parking in 2002 was between $127 billion and $374 billion. In the same year, the federal government spent $231 on Medicare and $349 billion for national defense"
- there are also feedback loops making the situation worse
	- there is no incentive to drive a smaller car, resulting in large parking spaces and more space needed
	- removing the pricing signal causes more people to drive, and parking requirements are often calculated based on peak demand, so more parking is needed
		- also the additional [[driving incurs costs on society]]
	- increased demand for parking also means that it can take longer to find a parking spot
					- this adds to congestion and results in unpredictable travel times
	- there is no incentive to park for a short time, resulting in people parking for longer and occupying parking spaces unnecessarily
	- off street parking is often unused during the week, meaning that parking supply is reduced (since that space could have been on street parking)
	- contributes to urban sprawl by making it easier to travel from low density areas by car to high density areas, which in turn causes more driving
