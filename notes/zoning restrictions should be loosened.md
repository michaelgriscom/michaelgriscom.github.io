- [[loosening zoning restrictions increases housing affordability]]
- zoning laws often inhibit dense and [Mixed use development](Mixed%20use%20development.md), and [[dense, mixed-use neighborhoods are good for individuals and communities]]
- Furthermore, [[exclusionary zoning amplifies segregation]] (zoning is rooted in [[redlining]])
	- Conversely, diverse housing creates diverse neighborhoods
		- different groups prefer different housing types
- loosening zoning requirements are likely to increase land values
	- increased land values can be captured via a [land value tax](land%20value%20tax.md) and re-invested in the community
