- bottom up
	- properties
		-  [[bottom up systems maximize agent freedom]]
			- this results in more room for creativity
		- [[bottom up systems amortize work across agents]]
		- [[bottom up systems decentralize power]]
		- individualist
	- when to use it
		- System is very complicated and optimal end structure is unknown
	- outcome
		- bottom up approaches create emergent systems
			- complex, organic, potential fractal
- top down
	- properties
		- top down systems centralize power
		- top down systems concentrate work at the top
		- collectivist
	- when to use it
		- System is prone to local optima
		- End goal is clearly defined
		- System is vulnerable to such as multipolar traps, coordination problems, and the tragedy of the commons
	- outcome
		- top down produces systems which are orderly, artificial, highly structured
